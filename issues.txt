1) Am I removing the views properly? Memory leak check!

2) This is especially an issue with the edit form for answer. I am wiping out the DOM when I switch forms but I don't believe I am properly removing all the sub views...

3) DRY up the voteCount function (it is in each of the models but maybe a mixin?)
4) Fix createdAt function. (This will involve figuring out how Javascript dates work)
